      <p>
        Art is a visual object or experience consciously created through an
        expression of skill or imagination. The term art encompasses diverse
        media such as painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, decorative
        arts, photography, and installation. The various visual arts exist
        within a continuum that ranges from purely aesthetic purposes at one end
        to purely utilitarian purposes at the other. Such a polarity of purpose
        is reflected in the commonly used terms artist and artisan, the latter
        understood as one who gives considerable attention to the utilitarian.
        This should by no means be taken as a rigid scheme, however. Even within
        one form of art, motives may vary widely; thus a potter or a weaver may
        create a highly functional work that is at the same time beautiful—a
        salad bowl, for example, or a blanket—or may create works that have no
        purpose beyond being admired.
